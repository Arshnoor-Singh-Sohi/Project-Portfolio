summary: "Every planned Manim video and SVG figure of this subject, the lesson that uses it, and its status."

## How a video or figure is made

1. Claude writes a prompt for Claude Code. The prompt names the misunderstanding, the scenes in order, the color legend and the output path.
2. I run the prompt in Claude Code in the background, one session at a time on this repository.
3. Claude Code renders the file, watches it, fixes visual problems and reports the duration.
4. Claude changes the status here. The lesson already has the `video` block.

Status values: **planned**, **prompt given**, **rendered**, **in lesson**.

All prompts are in one place: the Manim prompts page that Claude published for this study list (October 2026). Every video is 1920x1080 at 30 fps.

## Manim videos
